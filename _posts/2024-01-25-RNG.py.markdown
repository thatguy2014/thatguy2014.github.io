This is the link to the Random Number Generator with GUI that I created in python to learn more about how to use tkinter:

[Python Random Number Generator](https://github.com/thatguy2014/Python-RNG-w-gui/tree/main){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} 

This is the first time I've had to use python with most of my experience being with html and C++ so it was a great learning experience. It only took me about two days between schoolwork in order to finish this short little program. 

This project taught me how to use python and tkinter and how painful it can be to work with even a simple GUI.

On April 19th I attended an international Hackathon hosted by Freudenberg Sealing Technologies. I completed this hackathon with 3 other students at ONU: **Dax Amburgy**, **Quentin Osterhage**, and **Jamir Nunley**. During this Hackathon we were shown a video that gave us a basic outline of what freudenberg does. We were then provided with 5 excel files and 107 DAT files and told to process the information the best we could. 

Immediately we ran into a problem. All of the DAT files were in german. Luckily we were provided with a translation page, but we found it a pain to reference back and forth so we sought to create a python program that would automatically translate the data for us.

After accomplishing this task, we brainstormed what to do with this information. Since none of us know anything about data processing and were not given a very defined task we decided on a few things:
* We decided to convert all of our DAT files to CSVs
* We decided to combine all of the excel files into one large workbook
* Finally we attempted some data visualization

This was all we managed to get done in the time allotted. While we would have loved to find some information that could have helped us find new conclusions in the data we did not know enough about sealing technologies to comfortably come to those conclusions so we tried our best to make it easy for others to come to these conclusions.

This is the first time I've had to work with data and while I know a lot more about what we could have done I am still very satisfied with the work we got done.

This project taught me how to use python with DAT files as well as the basics of **data mining** and **data visualization**

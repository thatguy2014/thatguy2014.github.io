Hello! My name is Aiden Tallet and I am currently a Computer Science student at Ohio Northern University. 

I am on track to graduate with my Bachelors of Science a year early with a concentration in cybersecurity. This has required me to take 18 or more credit hours each semester, sometimes getting as high as 22 credits a semester.

In my freetime I love gaming and soccer. I've been doing both since I was in the second grade. I stopped playing soccer with a team at the end of high school after being the team captain for my junior and senior years. Now I am the team captain of ONU's JV Valorant team and spend a lot of my freetime working with my team.

I have been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. When I was in elementary school I watched my brother develop tools with an arduino and I was hooked. Then in 7th grade I was able to take a STEM class that focused on robotics and I was only drawn into computer science more. Since then, I've made a lot of programs in languages such as C++, C#, Python, Whitespace, Ada and more.
